# Catalytic-combustion
The project is about a reactor consisting of a ceramic pipe where one of the walls is covered by a thin solid catalytic layer.
The project concerns numerical analysis; precisely a DAE system where there are both PDE and ODE. The coupling zone takes palce along the catalytic layer.

The scope is to plot and visualize the gas concentration through the reactor along the x-axis for fixed y. The plots are both 3D and 2D.
